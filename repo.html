    <h3>Ahmednagar (officially Ahilyanagar)[4][5][6] is a city in, and the headquarters of, the Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. [7] Ahmednagar has several dozen buildings and sites from the Nizam Shahi period.[8] Ahmednagar Fort, once considered almost impregnable, was used by the British to house Jawaharlal Nehru (the first prime minister of India) and other Indian Nationalists before Indian independence. A few rooms there have been converted to a museum. During his confinement by the British at Ahmednagar Fort in 1944, Nehru wrote the book The Discovery of India.[9] Ahmednagar is home to the Indian Armoured Corps Centre & School (ACC&S), the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre (MIRC), the Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE) and the Controllerate of Quality Assurance Vehicles (CQAV). Training and recruitment for the Indian Army Armoured Corps takes place at the ACC&S.[10]
